# Cruise Ship KPI Analysis Milestones

## Repository Setup
- [x] Create a public GitHub repository.
- [x] Add a clear project name and description in the repository.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning
- [x] Load and review the dataset.
- [x] Handle missing or inconsistent data.
- [x] Ensure correct data types for each column.
- [x] Create summary statistics for key variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- [x] Visualize power consumption across different areas (e.g., propulsion, service areas).
- [x] Analyze correlations between variables like fuel flow, power, speed, and environmental factors (e.g., wind speed, sea temperature).
- [x] Plot performance trends over time for each vessel (e.g., power generation, fuel consumption).


## KPI Selection and Analysis
- [x] Identify and define key performance indicators (KPIs) for vessel efficiency (e.g., fuel efficiency, power-to-speed ratio).
- [x] Compare KPIs for Vessel 1 and Vessel 2.


## Document Insights and Narrative Development
- [x] Develop a narrative based on EDA findings and KPI analysis.
- [x] Explain performance trends and efficiency levels for each vessel.
- [x] Discuss any significant operational differences between Vessel 1 and Vessel 2.

## Repository Documentation
- [x] Create a `README.md` file with:
  - [x] Project overview.
  - [x] Setup instructions (e.g., required libraries, how to run the code).
  - [x] Explanation of key components (e.g., data sources, scripts, output).
- [x] Write clear comments and docstrings within the code.
- [x] Ensure all dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

## Final Review and Submission
- [x] Ensure code and documentation can be run independently on a standard laptop.
- [x] Double-check that the repository is well-organized and easy to navigate.

abstract: "This analysis investigates the operational performance of two cruise vessels of Cruise Company, respectively named Vessel 1 and Vessel 2, focusing on the significance of efficiency metrics amid rising fuel costs and environmental concerns. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were employed to evaluate each vessel's energy and operational efficiency. The Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) demonstrated that one vessel outperformed the other one. Operational efficiency metrics indicated that the more efficient vessel generated significantly more power per operational hour, suggesting better resource utilization. Additionally, fuel efficiency assessments highlighted a more effective fuel management strategy in the higher-performing vessel, which required less fuel to produce energy. Speed analysis further revealed that the more efficient vessel traveled faster, enhancing operational scheduling. These findings provide valuable insights that enable the Cruise Company to optimize operational practices, reduce costs, and align with sustainability goals, contributing to a more efficient and environmentally responsible maritime industry."

# Introduction

This report embarks on an exploratory analysis of the key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends for Vessel 1 and Vessel 2 throughout the year 2023. As the cruise industry sails into a future defined by sustainability and environmental responsibility, understanding the operational performance of these vessels becomes critical, not only for improving efficiency but also for ensuring compliance with upcoming regulations.

The European Union has set an ambitious target for all sectors, including maritime, to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 (B.V et al., 1970). This directive puts immense pressure on cruise companies to adapt and innovate, pushing them to rethink fuel consumption, emissions management, and overall operational strategies. For cruise companies, which are significant contributors to carbon emissions, this deadline marks a pivotal moment in their environmental and economic journey.

By analyzing the performance metrics of Vessel 1 and Vessel 2 of Cruise Company, this report will provide insights into their current operational status and identify key trends that could shape their path toward achieving the EU's sustainability goals. We will delve into essential factors such as fuel efficiency, voyage durations, and environmental impacts, all of which play a crucial role in assessing whether these vessels are on track to contribute to the broader net-zero objective.

The exploratory nature of this analysis allows us to uncover not only areas of strength but also potential challenges that lie ahead. As the cruise industry moves toward a future where environmental sustainability is no longer optional, understanding these performance trends will help inform decisions, innovations, and strategic directions for both the present and the long-term goals of the companies involved.

In doing so, this report seeks to provide a holistic view of how Vessel 1 and Vessel 2 are currently performing and how their operations align with the evolving expectations of the industry and the regulatory landscape of the European Union.

# Data Overview

The dataset comprises detailed registrations recorded every 5 minutes over a one-year period for two vessels, *Vessel 1 and Vessel 2*, belonging to the ***Cruise Company***. It covers the entire year of 2023, spanning from January 1st to December 31st.

To facilitate a deeper understanding of the dataset, a comprehensive description of each variable is available in the task_data folder, under the file named "schema.pdf". This document provides detailed insights into each parameter recorded in the dataset.

The dataset captures a wide array of operational metrics and environmental conditions, including key variables such as:

***Time and Location:*** 'Start Time', 'End Time', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', 'Local Time'

***Power Consumption:*** 'Power Galley 1 & 2', 'HVAC Chiller Power', 'Scrubber Power', 'Diesel Generator Power', 'Propulsion Power', 'Bow and Stern Thruster Power', and overall 'Total Power Consumption'

***Fuel Flow Rates:*** For boilers, incinerators, and main engines, including 'Boiler 1 & 2 Fuel Flow Rate' and 'Main Engine Fuel Flow Rates'

***Environmental Conditions:*** 'Sea Temperature', 'Relative and True Wind Speed and Direction'

***Performance Metrics:*** 'Speed Over Ground', 'Speed Through Water', 'Trim', 'Draft', and 'Duration'

This extensive dataset provides a foundation for exploring vessel performance, fuel consumption, environmental impact, and power usage across various systems onboard the vessels. By leveraging these variables, this analysis will offer valuable insights into operational efficiency and highlight areas where improvements can be made in line with the industry’s evolving environmental goals.

# Methodology

## Preprocessing steps

The dataset under examination comprises 44 variables and a total of 210,240 observations, with each observation representing measurements taken at five-minute intervals across various parameters. In the preprocessing stage, we first assessed the dataset for missing values, discovering that the variable "Depth (m)" contained over 27% of its observations as null. Given its negligible impact on the overall analysis and key performance indicators (KPIs), we opted to remove this variable entirely.

Subsequently, we found that the remaining variables each had less than 1% of their total observations missing. For these, we employed the ***Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)*** technique to handle the missing data. 

***MICE*** operates on the assumption that data is Missing At Random (MAR), which posits that the likelihood of a value being absent is contingent solely on observed values (Makaba & Dogo, 2019). This method iteratively predicts missing values based on the relationships among other variables in the dataset, employing regression models to generate multiple imputed values. Each missing variable is treated as a dependent variable, while the remaining data serves as independent variables. It is critical to recognize that applying MICE under non-MAR assumptions may yield biased results (Azur et al., 2011). Following this imputation process, the dataset was free of missing values.

We then converted the datetime information into the correct format and performed a thorough check for any duplicate observations, which could potentially compromise the integrity of our analysis. Fortunately, no duplicates were identified; if they had existed, we would have removed them to ensure a clean dataset.

With a complete dataset in hand, we computed the total power consumption by aggregating the power usage from various systems, including galleys, HVAC chillers, generators, and propulsion units. Additionally, we calculated the total fuel flow rates for all engines and boilers by summing their respective fuel consumption rates. We also identified key columns, such as 'Sea Temperature (Celsius)' and various speed measurements, adjusting their values by dividing by 288 to facilitate daily analysis. These transformations enhanced our capacity to conduct a detailed examination of power usage, fuel consumption patterns, and other operational metrics over time.

Lastly, we organized the data by grouping it according to vessel names, specifically 'Vessel 1' and 'Vessel 2', and by day, resulting in the creation of a new dataset tailored for subsequent analyses.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Boxplot Analysis of Numerical Variables

To visually assess the presence of potential outliers in the dataset, a boxplot was generated for the numerical variables. Boxplots provide an effective way to detect extreme values, illustrating any deviations from the expected distribution within the data.


```{python}
#| label: Boxplots of numerical variables
#| echo: false
#| message: false


# Create a list of numerical variables
numerical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include='number').columns

# Melt the DataFrame to long format for FacetGrid
df_melted = df.melt(value_vars=numerical_columns, var_name='Feature', value_name='Value')

# Create a FacetGrid with boxplots for each numerical variable
g = sns.FacetGrid(df_melted, col='Feature', col_wrap=4, height=4, sharex=False, sharey=False)

# Map the boxplot while ensuring we correctly define the axes
g.map_dataframe(sns.boxplot, x='Value', color='skyblue')

g.set_titles(col_template="{col_name}")
g.set_axis_labels('Value', 'Feature')
plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)
g.fig.suptitle('Boxplots of Numerical Features', fontsize=16)

plt.show()

```

From the boxplot analysis, several variables, such as Power Galley 1 (MW), Power Galley 2 (MW), and HVAC Chiller 3 Power (MW) exhibit noticeable outliers. These deviations could suggest irregularities or extreme fluctuations in power consumption, which may warrant further investigation 
under different analytical contexts.

However, given that the objective of this analysis is exploratory rather than predictive, and we are not constructing machine learning models that depend on the removal of outliers for improved performance, no immediate 
steps will be taken to eliminate these values. It is important to note that the process of outlier removal should be informed by domain-specific  knowledge of the variables in question, as uninformed removal might 
distort the data's integrity or overlook significant trends. Therefore, we retain the outliers for the purpose of this analysis to ensure the  completeness of the exploratory study.

# Performance Analysis

The performance analysis of the cruise vessels focuses on evaluating trends over time, and key operational metrics to determine their efficiency and effectiveness. By examining various KPIs, we can assess the vessels' energy usage, fuel efficiency, and operational output, providing a detailed understanding of their overall performance.

## Total Power Consumption (MW) Over Time by Vessel

The graph illustrates the total power consumption of two 
vessels over time, with data recorded at 5-minute intervals 
throughout 2023. This total power consumption is calculated 
by aggregating the energy usage from various components, 
including propulsion systems, generators, HVAC chillers, 
and galley power, allowing for a comprehensive overview of 
each vessel's energy demands.

Each line reflects the fluctuations in power usage for 
two specific vessels, enabling a detailed comparison of 
their energy consumption patterns over this period.


```{python}
#| label: Plot1
#| echo: false
#| message: false


plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

sns.lineplot(data=df, x='Date', y='Total Power Consumption (MW)', hue='Vessel Name', palette='Set1')

# Set plot labels and title
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Total Power Consumption (MW)')
plt.title('Total Power Consumption Over Time by Vessel - 5 minute intervals')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(title='Vessel')

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

In the graph, Vessel 1 is depicted in red, while Vessel 2 is  shown in blue. The vertical axis measures total power 
consumption in megawatts (MW), ranging from 0 to 100 MW, 
while the horizontal axis covers the date range from 
January 2023 to December 2023.

Both vessels exhibit considerable variability in power 
usage. Vessel 1 shows higher and more frequent spikes, 
especially during the early months of 2023, indicating 
times of intense energy consumption. The power consumption 
of Vessel 2, while also fluctuating, appears to be somewhat 
steadier but still includes periods of significant activity, particularly during mid-to-late 2023.

This plot provides a comprehensive view of each vessels 
energy demands, highlighting their operational patterns and 
potential times of peak activity.

Now we want to see the daily total power consumption of each
of the vessels of Cruise Company, during the year 2023.

The graph illustrates the daily power consumption of Vessel 
1 (red) and Vessel 2 (blue) throughout 2023.

```{python}
#| label: Plot2
#| echo: false
#| message: false

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

sns.lineplot(data=df_grouped_by_day_vessel, x='Date', y='Total Power Consumption (MW)', hue='Vessel Name', palette='Set1')

# Set plot labels and title
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Total Power Consumption (MW)')
plt.title('Total Power Consumption Over Time by Vessel - daily')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(title='Vessel')

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```


Vessel 1 demonstrates significant fluctuations in power 
usage, with sharp peaks, particularly observed in January 
and February, where it reaches maximum consumption levels 
exceeding 25,000 MW. These variations suggest that Vessel 1 
may be engaged in operations that require varying energy 
inputs, potentially reflecting high-demand periods or 
intensive operational activities.

In contrast, Vessel 2 exhibits a more consistent consumption pattern with less volatility. Its consumption occasionally spikes, notably in July and November, where it also surpasses 20,000 MW. However, the majority of its daily power usage remains within a range of 5,000 MW to 15,000 MW, indicating a more stable operational profile compared to Vessel 1.

Overall, the contrasting power consumption patterns 
highlight the differing operational demands and energy 
management strategies of each vessel throughout the year. 
Vessel 1's variability may necessitate a more flexible energy 
supply, while Vessel 2 steadiness could reflect a more 
predictable operational rhythm.

### Contribution of Power Sources to Total Power Consumption (MW)

Following this analysis, we aim to examine how specific 
components of Vessel 1 and Vessel 2 contribute to total 
power consumption throughout 2023. To visualize this 
contribution effectively, we will employ pie charts that 
illustrate the respective percentages of each component for 
both vessels.

This approach will enable us to see the relative 
significance of each component in the overall energy usage, 
facilitating a deeper understanding of their operational 
efficiencies and highlighting areas where energy management 
may be optimized. By comparing the distribution of power 
consumption across different components within each vessel, 
we can identify patterns and dependencies that may inform 
future strategies for energy optimization and resource 
allocation.


```{python}
#| label: Plot3

```

Starting with ***Vessel 1***, we observe that ***Propulsion Power is the primary driver of energy consumption***, accounting for  22.6% of the total. This significant portion underscores the vessel's reliance on propulsion systems, essential for its movement and operational capabilities. ***Power Service follows as the second-largest contributor*** at 14.5%, indicating a substantial demand for onboard electrical services, likely essential for navigation and operational support.

Interestingly, ***Diesel Generator 3*** plays a crucial role, contributing 13.6% to the power consumption. This suggests that it may be the preferred generator for auxiliary power needs, complementing the propulsion systems effectively. The starboard and port side propulsion systems each hold comparable shares, contributing 11.4% and 11.2% respectively. This balance illustrates a well-distributed power usage strategy, essential for maintaining stability and maneuverability.

In contrast, ***Vessel 2*** also highlights ***Propulsion Power as a key component*** but at a slightly lower contribution of 20.5%. This reduction suggests a potential improvement in operational efficiency or a different operational profile compared to Vessel 1. The Power Service demand is more pronounced in Vessel 2, with 17.3% of total consumption, reflecting perhaps a greater reliance on electrical services for onboard functions.

***Diesel Generator 3*** maintains its critical role in Vessel 2 as well, albeit with a lower share of 12.3%. Both starboard and port side propulsion systems have similar contributions, reflecting a consistent design choice for propulsion across both vessels. However, the slight variance in the percentages may indicate different operational conditions or maintenance practices.

Overall, the analysis reveals that both vessels heavily 
depend on propulsion systems for their operational needs. However, differences in power consumption patterns suggest opportunities for efficiency improvements.

## Total Fuel Flow Rate (kg/h) Over Time by Vessel

The graph illustrates the *fuel flow rate of two vessels of  Cruise Company over time*, with data recorded in kilograms per hour (kg/h) throughout 2023. This total fuel flow rate is calculated by aggregating the fuel consumption from the four main engines onboard each vessel, providing a comprehensive overview of their operational fuel demands.

Each line represents the variations in fuel usage for the two vessels, allowing for a detailed comparison of their fuel consumption patterns over the specified period.

```

The plot provides a comprehensive overview of the fuel consumption patterns for two vessels operated by Cruise Company throughout 2023. Initially, ***Vessel 1*** exhibited significant fluctuations in its total fuel flow rate until May, reflecting variable operational demands. Following this period, from June to November, fuel consumption stabilized, albeit with periodic spikes. Notably, the latter months of the year saw a marked increase in fuel flow, indicating a potential surge in activity or operational changes.

In contrast,***Vessel 2***, represented by the blue line, displayed a consistent yet lower fuel flow rate compared to Vessel 1 during the first quarter of the year. However, from May to November, its operational profile shifted dramatically, with a noticeable increase in fuel consumption, surpassing that of Vessel 1. This trend suggests that Vessel 2 was likely engaged in more intensive operations, perhaps due to increased passenger demand or extended voyages.

## Total Boiler Flow Rate (kg/h) Over Time by Vessel

The graphs depict the *temporal dynamics of boiler fuel flow rates for two vessels operated by the Cruise Company throughout 2023*, expressed in litres per hour (L/h). The total fuel flow rate is calculated by aggregating the fuel consumption from the two principal boilers on each vessel, thereby providing a nuanced understanding of their operational fuel demands.

Each line in the graphs encapsulates the variations in boiler fuel usage, enabling a comparative analysis of the fuel consumption patterns exhibited by the two vessels over the specified one year timeframe. 


```{python}
#| label: Plot7
#| echo: false
#| message: false

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

sns.lineplot(data=df, x='Date', y='All Boiler Fuel Flow Rate (L/h)', hue='Vessel Name', palette='Set1')

# Set plot labels and title

plt.title('Total Boiler Fuel Flow Rate Over Time by Vessel')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend(title='Vessel')

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

The graph illustrates that *Vessel 2* consistently exhibits higher values of total boiler fuel flow rates (L/h), with a notable peak occurring in June. This vessel experiences significant fluctuations in fuel flow, highlighting its variable operational demands throughout the year. In contrast, Vessel 1 demonstrates much lower fuel flow rates, with its maximum values recorded at the end of March and the beginning of April.


```{python}
#| label: Plot8
#| echo: false
#| message: false


plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

```

Analyzing the daily fluctuations in total boiler fuel flow rates reveals that *Vessel 2* reached an impressive peak of over 80,000 litres per hour in June, while Vessel 1 peaked at approximately 40,000 litres per hour, indicating that Vessel 2's consumption is effectively double that of Vessel 1. This disparity raises important questions regarding the environmental implications of such high fuel consumption. The observed peak may correspond to a busy operational period, prompting further investigation into the underlying factors contributing to this increase and its potential environmental impact.

### Contribution of Boiler Fuel Flow Rates to Total Fuel Consumption (L/h)

The pie charts  illustrate the *distribution of boiler fuel flow rates across the two boilers in each vessel*, highlighting their respective roles in total fuel consumption. 

In Vessel 1, ***Boiler 1 takes the lead***, while Boiler 2 closely follows, showcasing a balanced operational dynamic.

In contrast, Vessel 2 presents a different narrative; ***Boiler 2 emerges as the dominant player***, indicating a shift in fuel utilization patterns.

## Impact of Sea Conditions

### Speed vs Total Engines Fuel Flow Rate (kg/h)

Next, we aim to visualize the ***relationship between the speed of each vessel and the total engine fuel flow rate***. This analysis will provide insights into how variations in speed influence fuel consumption across the specific vessels.

```{python}

    vessel_2_data['All Engines Fuel Flow Rate (kg/h)']  # Replace with  actual fuel consumption column name
)

# Create scatter plot for Vessel 2
fig_speed_power_vessel_2 = px.scatter(
    vessel_2_data,
    x='Speed Over Ground (knots)',  # Actual speed column name

    title=f'Speed vs. Total Fuel Flow Rate - Vessel 2 (Pearson Correlation: {pearson_corr_vessel_2_power:.2f})',
    labels={

print(f'Pearson correlation for Vessel 2 (All Engines Fuel Flow Rate (kg/h)): {pearson_corr_vessel_2_power:.2f}')

```

Based on the scatter plots, a ***positive correlation*** is evident between the speed of the vessels and their total engine fuel flow rate. This relationship aligns with theoretical expectations, as ***increased speed typically necessitates higher fuel consumption to maintain operational efficiency***. For ***Vessel 1***, the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated to be ***0.88***, indicating a strong association between the two variables; as the speed in knots increases, there is a corresponding increase in fuel expenditure by the engines. Similarly, ***Vessel 2*** exhibits an even stronger correlation, with a Pearson coefficient of ***0.90***, further reinforcing the notion that heightened speed significantly impacts fuel consumption.

```

### Speed vs Total Power Consumption (MW)

Now, we aim to explore the ***relationship between speed over ground, measured in knots, and the total power consumption across various components of the vessels, expressed in megawatts***. This analysis will focus specifically on the two vessels operated by Cruise Company, providing insights into how vessel speed influences power demands across different operational systems.

```{python}

print(f'Pearson correlation for Vessel 1 (Power Consumption): {pearson_corr_vessel_1_power:.2f}')
print(f'Pearson correlation for Vessel 2 (Power Consumption): {pearson_corr_vessel_2_power:.2f}')

```

The analysis of the relationship between speed over ground and total power consumption for the two vessels reveals compelling insights. For ***Vessel 1***, a Pearson correlation coefficient of ***0.90*** indicates a strong positive correlation, suggesting that as the speed of the vessel increases, so does the power consumption across its various operational components. This trend signifies that the vessel’s energy demands are closely tied to its speed, underscoring the implications for fuel efficiency and operational costs.

Similarly, ***Vessel 2*** exhibits an even stronger correlation with a Pearson coefficient of ***0.91***. This reinforces the notion that higher speeds lead to increased power consumption, suggesting that Vessel 2’s operational systems are highly responsive to changes in speed. The slight difference in correlation coefficients between the two vessels indicates potential variations in their design or operational efficiencies, which could be pivotal for optimizing performance.

### Sea Temperature (Celcius) vs Total Power Consumption (MW)

Analyzing the ***interplay between environmental conditions and energy consumption*** is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency in maritime operations. In this context, we aim to examine whether sea temperature affects total power consumption across the two vessels operated by Cruise Company.

To explore this relationship, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients for each vessel, which serve as a quantitative measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between sea temperature (in Celsius) and total power consumption (in megawatts). 

```{python}
#| label: Plot12

```

The exploration of the relationship between sea temperature and total power consumption for the two vessels presents intriguing insights. For ***Vessel 1***, the Pearson correlation coefficient of ***0.10*** indicates a negligible positive correlation between sea temperature and power consumption. This suggests that variations in sea temperature have little to no impact on the vessel’s energy demands, highlighting a degree of operational consistency regardless of external thermal conditions.

In contrast, ***Vessel 2*** exhibits a negative Pearson correlation coefficient of ***-0.25***. This negative relationship implies that as sea temperature increases, the power consumption of Vessel 2 tends to decrease. Such an outcome may indicate the vessel's reliance on cooling systems that become more efficient in warmer waters or that certain operational parameters adapt to the thermal environment, resulting in lower energy usage.

print(f'Pearson correlation for Vessel 2 (All Engines Fuel Flow Rate (kg/h)): {pearson_corr_vessel_2_power:.2f}')

```

For ***Vessel 1***, the correlation coefficient is ***0.10***, indicating a negligible positive relationship between sea temperature and fuel flow rate. This suggests that changes in sea temperature have little to no effect on the fuel consumption of Vessel 1's engines, indicating a stable operational profile that is largely insulated from variations in thermal conditions.

In contrast, ***Vessel 2*** exhibits a Pearson correlation coefficient of ***-0.26***, suggesting a moderate negative correlation. This indicates that as sea temperature increases, the all engines fuel flow rate for Vessel 2 tends to decrease. This relationship may imply potential operational efficiencies, such as reduced engine load requirements or more efficient fuel consumption patterns in warmer waters.

These insights highlight the distinct operational dynamics of each vessel in relation to environmental factors. Vessel 1 shows a consistent fuel flow rate unaffected by sea temperature, suggesting that its engines operate independently of thermal variations. Conversely, Vessel 2 may take advantage of warmer sea temperatures to optimize fuel efficiency, thereby reducing overall fuel consumption.


# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

***Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)*** serve as vital benchmarks for assessing the operational efficiency and performance of cruise vessels. These metrics provide valuable insights into various aspects of vessel operation, enabling stakeholders to identify areas for improvement, optimize resource utilization, and enhance overall sustainability. By analyzing KPIs, we can make informed decisions regarding fuel consumption, power generation, and operational practices, ultimately leading to more efficient maritime operations.

In this analysis, KPIs have been calculated to evaluate the performance of the cruise vessels under consideration. The KPIs include:

## 1. Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER)
- **Calculation**: The EER is calculated by dividing the total power produced (in megawatts) by the total fuel consumed (in kilograms per hour).
- **Purpose**: This ratio indicates how efficiently the vessels convert fuel into energy. A higher EER suggests that the vessel is using fuel more effectively to produce power.

## 2. Operational Efficiency (MW/hour)
- **Calculation**: This metric is determined by dividing the total power produced by the operational hours (the total time the vessel was active).
- **Purpose**: Operational efficiency reflects how much power is generated per hour of operation, allowing stakeholders to understand how effectively the vessel is performing during its operational time.

## 3. Fuel Efficiency (kg/MW)
- **Calculation**: Fuel efficiency is calculated by dividing the total fuel consumed (in kilograms per hour) by the total power produced (in megawatts).
- **Purpose**: This KPI measures the amount of fuel required to produce one megawatt of power. A lower value indicates better fuel efficiency, meaning the vessel is consuming less fuel to generate the same amount of energy.

## 4. Average Speed (knots)
- **Calculation**: Average speed is determined by dividing the total distance traveled  by the operational hours.
- **Purpose**: This metric provides insights into the vessel’s performance in terms of speed during its operational period, allowing for comparisons with expected travel times and operational planning.

By calculating these KPIs, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of how effectively each vessel is utilizing fuel, generating power, and operating over time. This information is essential for optimizing vessel performance, reducing operational costs, and enhancing sustainability in maritime operations. The analysis of these KPIs not only aids in operational decision-making but also contributes to the broader goals of environmental responsibility and economic efficiency in the maritime industry.

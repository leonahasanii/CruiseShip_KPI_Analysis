- Setup Instructions for Cruise Vessel Performance Analysis

Prerequisites
To replicate or perform further analysis on this project, the following requirements must be met:

VS Code (Visual Studio Code) IDE
You will need to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding and analysis. For this project, Visual Studio Code was used.

Download and install from:
VS Code

Quarto Installed
Before running the .qmd (Quarto Markdown) file, make sure that Quarto is installed on your machine. Quarto is an open-source technical publishing system that enables the rendering of the .qmd file into HTML format.

You can install Quarto from:
Quarto Install Guide

Python Installed
The analysis relies on several Python libraries. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. You can download the latest version from:
Python Official Site

- Setting up the Environment
To install the necessary libraries, create a virtual environment and activate it:

bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On MacOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Next, install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
# Install necessary Python libraries
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy statsmodels sklearn plotly
Here are the libraries used in this project:

pandas – For data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib – For plotting and visualizations
seaborn – For enhanced data visualizations
numpy – For numerical computations
scipy – For scientific computing, including statistical analysis
statsmodels – For statistical models and hypothesis testing
sklearn – For machine learning models and preprocessing
plotly – For interactive data visualizations
These libraries can be installed all together using the pip command above.

Replicating the Analysis
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

Download the Repository
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the Scripts Folder
Open the scripts/ folder, where the Quarto (.qmd) file is located.

Open the Project in VS Code
Use VS Code to open the project. Make sure that Quarto is correctly installed and set up in your VS Code.

Run the Quarto File
To generate the analysis report, run the Quarto file by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
quarto render kpi_analysis.qmd
This will generate the HTML report in the output/ folder.

Viewing the Project Without Additional Setup
If you only want to view the results and insights of the analysis, you can download and open the pre-generated report:

Download the Report
Download the ProjectTask.html file located in the output/ folder.

Open the HTML File
You can view the report by opening ProjectTask.html in any web browser. No need to install any Python libraries or Quarto setup if you only wish to view the report.

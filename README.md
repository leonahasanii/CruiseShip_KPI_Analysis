# Cruise Vessel Performance Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of cruise vessel performance using Python code written in a Quarto (`.qmd`) file. The project focuses on evaluating operational metrics such as fuel efficiency, power generation, and other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to optimize maritime resource usage and improve sustainability.


## Introduction

This project analyzes the performance of two cruise vessels of ***Cruise Company*** by looking at trends over time, and calculating key operational metrics and KPIs. By understanding how vessels convert fuel into power and how they operate under different conditions, the analysis aims to optimize future operations while reducing the environmental impact.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes several operational metrics like fuel consumption, energy generation, vessel speed, and operational hours. These metrics were used to calculate KPIs, which serve as benchmarks for assessing vessel performance.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The KPIs cover various dimensions of vessel performance, such as energy efficiency, fuel efficiency, and operational output. These metrics are essential for improving the overall sustainability and economic efficiency of the vessels.

## Performance Analysis

This section evaluates how well each vessel performs based on the KPIs, identifying areas where improvements can be made. The report generated provides insights into optimizing fuel usage, power generation, and operational practices for future voyages.

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights significant insights into the operational efficiencies of cruise vessels, with a focus on improving fuel usage and reducing environmental impact. 

## Limitations and Outlook

While the current dataset provides valuable insights, the absence of historical data limits the ability to track improvements over time. If historical data spanning at least the last ten years were available, we could analyze trends in fuel efficiency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions, providing a clearer picture of operational progress. Additionally, incorporating carbon emissions data would offer a more comprehensive view of the vessels' environmental impact. Future work could integrate these elements for a more robust analysis.
